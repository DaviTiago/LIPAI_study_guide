"""Indentifiers"""

# Identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects in Python.
# They must follow certain rules:
# 1. Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as identifiers:
# True, False, None, and import, keywords like if, else, for, while, def, class, etc.
